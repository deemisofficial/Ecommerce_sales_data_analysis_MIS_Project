It demonstrates how data analytics and visualization can transform business challenges into opportunities, guiding smarter decisions and sustainable growth.
As part of my data analytics journey, I created a detailed dashboard to analyze E-Commerce sales performance in 2024. The objective was to identify key customer segments and growth opportunities for 2025.

📊 Key Insights from the Dashboard:

👩 Women buyers dominate with ~65% share of sales.

🌍 Top-performing states: Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Uttar Pradesh (~35% contribution).

👨‍👩‍👧 The adult age group (30–49 years) drives ~50% of total sales.

🛒 E-commerce platforms (Amazon, Flipkart, Myntra) account for ~80% of sales.

💡 Strategic Recommendation for 2025:
Focus marketing efforts on women (30–49 years) in Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Uttar Pradesh, leveraging digital channels with personalized promotions, offers, and targeted campaigns.

This exercise not only strengthened my Excel, data visualization, and storytelling skills but also highlighted how businesses can transform raw data into actionable strategies.
